“can use the open source library REST Assured (http://rest-assured.io/). 
REST Assured allows the validation of REST services by means of a fluent API inspired in dynamic languages such as Ruby or Groovy.
 
 
 
To use REST Assured in our test project, we simply need to add the proper dependency in Maven:”

````
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
   <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
   <version>3.0.0</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>”]
